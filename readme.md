# slides

these are slides for various talks that I've done

to reproduce:

1. clone the deck.js git repo into the static folder.

        git clone git://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js.git static

2. clone the codemirror extension into the static/extensions/codemirror folder

        git clone git://github.com/iros/deck.js-codemirror.git codemirror
