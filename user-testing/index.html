	<h2>Why Bother?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>You are not your user</h3>
			<!-- We spend WAY more time on Twilio's website than any of our users.
			The typical user has 20 tabs open and ten things to do, and ONE of them 
			is ours. Things that make sense to us are confusing to new users.

			Examples:
			- Helper Libraries
			- Difference between REST, Twiml

			Converse: Don't need to user test for internal tools.

			Note: User testing is good for measuring outcomes, not for measuring how 
			people feel about a design
			-->
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>User testing will expose flaws in your design</h3>
			<!-- No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy. Since your
			users are the ones that are actually working with your design every day, 
			they are the ones you should be watching to figure out whether your 
			design is working as anticipated.
			-->
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Better Usability = More Users</h3>
			<!-- If our users can't figure out how to use our product, we lose money
			- either from people not figuring out how to spend it on our platform, 
			switching to a competitor, or just not integrating voice/SMS
			-->
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Good Code != Good User Experience</h3>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>People fail in dumb ways</h3>
			<!-- Ways I've seen people fail:

			- Can't find their Auth Token
			- Can't find our helper libraries
			- Got stuck on the Voicemail Howto
			- Don't know how to use Pip
			- Thought they validated a phone number, but it failed
			- Kept clicking on "How it Works" to find examples of how to send an SMS
			-->
		</li>

<section class="slide" id="find-people">
	<h1>Step 1: Find People</h1>
  <!-- This is the hardest part by far. As a result I am always on the lookout
  for people to test. 

  How important is it to find representative users? This is a good question.
  It's not ideal, and may leave you with concerns about the product that aren't 
  necessarily problems, but it's better than nothing.

  Another thing you can do is find a task to suit the person at hand. For 
  example, you could ask someone with non-technical skills to browse our 
  marketing pages and then "write up 5 bullet points for their boss explaining 
  the pros and cons of the product". Or ask them to try and find someone to 
  build their Twilio app and see where they look (oDesk, similar)

  <h1>Step 2: Assign Representative Tasks</h1>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="good-task-properties">
<h2>A good task:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Should take &lt;30 mins, unless you are paying the user</h3>
      <!-- Beware! Something you think is easy may be hard. -->
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Shouldn't use vocabulary specific to your product</h3>
      <!-- eg, Twilio Connect -->
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Should have a clear outcome</h3>
		</li>

<section class="slide" id="example-tasks">
<h2>Examples</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Send an SMS to your phone</h3>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Buy a phone number in your area code</h3>
		</li>
    <li>
      <h3>Boxconfig - Find a recent 500 server error</h3>

    <h3>Your boss at a small business wants an application he can use to
    send text messages to customers. Research possible solutions and make a
    recommendation to your boss.</h3>

<section class="slide" id="before-the-test">
  <h2>Before the test</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>If you are recording their voice or face, ask permission</h3>
    <!-- In general it's good for you to record the test. A notepad is fine at
    the minimum, video recording can be good for persuading other members of
    your team. Try not to record their face if possible. -->
    <li><h3>Tell the user to bring their own equipment</h3>
    <!-- You are going to get more out of the test by watching them closer to
    the way they've actually worked. -->
    <li><h3>Ask about the user's background</h3></li>
    <!-- What languages are they familiar with? Have they worked with API's
    before? Have they heard of Twilio's API before, or used it? -->
    <li><h3>Tell the user we are testing the product, not them</h3>
    <!-- Many people will apologize for not doing well during the test, they
    think it's their fault. The opposite is true; the interface is always the 
    problem. Explain that we are testing the interface, not your ability. -->
    <li><h3>Ask them to think aloud during the test</h3>
    <!-- This one will probably require prompting, it's not natural for people
    and they will want to appear smart. -->
    <li><h3>Give them the task</h3>
  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="asking-questions">
  <h2>During the test</h2>
  <p>In general, DON'T ask questions or interrupt the user. But if you have to, 
  be very careful not to bias the user. Here are some good unbiased questions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>"What are you thinking about?"</h3>
    <!-- Ask them to do whatever they would do in their office. -->
    <li><h3>"What were you expecting to see when you clicked that button?"</h3></li>
    <li><h3>"What are you trying to do now?"</li>

<section class="slide" id="bad-questions">
  <h2>Bad questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>"Why didn't you click on the red button?"</h3>
    <li><h3>"Did you see (the menu option/the blue box)?"</h3></li>
    <!-- In general users will give untrustworthy answers to these questions. 
    "I didn't see it because it was small" ok maybe, all we know is you didn't 
    see it. -->
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="common-problems">
  <h2>Other common problems/questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>"Is this the right place to click?"</h3>
    <!-- Ask them to do whatever they would do in their office. -->
    <li><h3>"I don't know what to do."</h3></li>
    <li><h3>"I'm stuck."</h3></li>
    <li><h3>&lt;silence&gt;</h3>
    <li><h3>"Well it looks like this is the documentation over here, and this is where I'd click to sign up for an account, and oh this looks neat, ..."</h3></li>

<section class="slide" id="recapping-the-test">
  <h2>Recapping the test</h2>
  <ol>
