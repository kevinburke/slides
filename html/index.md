## CSS

- This is the part where you can actually make something that looks pretty

- Put simply CSS is the part where you style all of the content from the first
  half. It's amazingly flexible

- CSS Zen Garden

- Put your CSS in a separate file.

html {
    background-color: azure;
}

img {
    padding: 5px;
    border: 1px solid gray;
}

- What if we don't want all the links to change color, or all of the images to
  have a border?

<img class="bordered-image" src="blah" />

.bordered-image {

}

- What if we have two rules, which one wins?
